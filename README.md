# Array Challenge

## Challenge 1

**Instructions:**

> Use some of the array methods that we've looked at to mutate the following array to the expected results below.
> Reverse the order of the array.

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

**Expected results:**

```js
console.log(arr); // [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0];
```

## Challenge 2

**Instructions:**

Combine `arr1` and `arr2` into a new array called `arr3` with the following elements:

```js
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const arr2 = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
```

Notice That `arr1` and `arr2` include the number 5. You will need to find a way to get rid of the extra 5.

**Expected Result**

```js
console.log(arr3); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
```
